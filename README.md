## Methodology

The following techniques have been used in this project:

* K-Means Clustering
* Naive Bayes
* SVM
* Linear Regression
*  Results

The EDA revealed that the greatest number of complaints come from the Brooklyn borough and that the majority of complaints are related to misdemeanors. The report also found that a high percentage of complaints were related to offenses in the "Offenses Against Public Administration" category. Additionally, the report found that the data can be plotted on a map but it is hard to distinguish the crimes because of the number of data points in the data set.

## Conclusion

This project provides a high-level overview of the types of crime that are reported in New York City and highlights some key patterns in the data. Further analysis could be done to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify specific areas of concern.
